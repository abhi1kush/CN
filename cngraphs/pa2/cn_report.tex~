\subsection{Exercise 1.1}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.4]{Q1.1/tcp_throughput}  
\includegraphics[scale = 0.4]{Q1.1/congestion_window}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.25]{Q1.1/time_SEQ}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.25]{Q1.1/queue_occupancy}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.25]{Q1.1/queueing_delay}

Avg Throughput is 4.45 Mbps which is close to 5 Mbps but in last seconds graph goes down which indicate momentarily 
fall in throughput.

TCP algorithm reduces cwnd 25 times .
Because it this version TCP NewReno which uses 
AIMD algorithms to mainatain congestion window 
so when it crosses ssthershold value it become half of previous size .  

\subsection{Exercise 1.2}

\includegraphics[scale = 0.4]{Q1.2/time_SEQ.png} 
\includegraphics[scale = 0.4]{Q1.2/tcp_throughput.png}  
\includegraphics[scale = 0.25]{Q1.2/congestion_window.png}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.25]{Q1.2/queue_occupancy.png}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.25]{Q1.2/queueing_delay.png}

In this case we increased Link rate to 50 Mbps so BDP increased,
TCP will try to estimate ideal window size by increasing window size with slow start .
that will create congestion and then cwnd will decrease multiplicatively .
due this decreased cwnd size throughput will decrease .

* Main Reason for low throughput is mismatch between queue size and  Window size and BDP.
window allows large no. of packets, which are too much for 10 size queue leads to discard packets and congestion
and then retransmission of these packets.

\subsection{Exercise 1.3}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.4]{Q1.3/avg_throughput_q3.png}

{\bf Graphs with 50ms 100ms delays}

\includegraphics[scale = 0.25]{Q1.3/50ms/time_SEQ.png}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.25]{Q1.3/100ms/time_SEQ.png}

\includegraphics[scale = 0.25]{Q1.3/50ms/congestion_window.png}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.25]{Q1.3/100ms/congestion_window.png}

In this case delay is increased so BDP increased and but link rate is same .
window size will increase with slow start until link is congested and queue is overflowed .
According to CWND graphs
After congestion reciever buffer is too overflowed then he sends advertised window to limit increase of congestion 
window after that Congestion Avoidance starts .
Main cause of low throughput is large increase in window size with short queue size .

\subsection{Exercise 1.4}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.4]{Q1.4/avg_throughput_q4.png}

\includegraphics[scale = 0.25]{Q1.4/rate10^-3/time_SEQ.png}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.25]{Q1.4/rate10^-4/time_SEQ.png}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.25]{Q1.4/rate10^-5/time_SEQ.png}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.25]{Q1.4/rate10^-6/time_SEQ.png}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.25]{Q1.4/rate10^-7/time_SEQ.png}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.25]{Q1.4/rate10^-8/time_SEQ.png}

$Time Sequence Graphs with link rate 10^{-3},10^{-4},10^{-5},10^{-6},10^{-7},10^{-8} respectively$ 

In this case Due to high loss rate Packetes went missing so it leads to Retransmission 
So there is lot of retransmited packetes and lack of fresh new packets Th

\item{Average Queueing Delay = 0.035567 sec}
\item{Average CWND Size = 29370.49}
\item{Average Queue Occupancy = 38.889}

\begin{itemize}
\item{Average Throughput = 4.588 Mbps}
\item{Average Queueing Delay = 0.053796 sec}
\item{Average CWND Size = 39336.18}
\item{Average Queue Occupancy = 58.49}
\end{itemize}

\item{Queue Size 1000}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Average Throughput = 4.588 Mbps}
\item{Average Queueing Delay = 0.053796 sec }
\item{Average CWND Size = 39336.18}
\item{Average Queue Occupancy = 58.493}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Avg throughput icreasing with queue size significantly upto 1000
after that there is negiligble improvement and queueing delay still increase

So ideal queue size for this simulation is 100
